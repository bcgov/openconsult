## The OpenConsult Data Standard

**OpenConsult** is a draft open standard for publishing data about public consultations.  The standard was initiated in December 2015 as a joint project of the Province of British Columbia and PlaceSpeak.com, under the umbrella of the BCDevExchange program.

Please note that there is a major re-working of the standard currently being floated for comment in [this pull request](https://github.com/bcgov/openconsult/pull/2).

## Features
